         <h1>Katie McDonagh </h1>
          <p>Hey everyone I graduated from Makers Academy 2 weeks ago, currently looking for my first role as a software developer, I mainly code in JS and am really looking forward to working on my html-css skills this evening, and of course to meet all of you! Before Makers I was a Coffee Trainer, and although I still love coffee, making the swap to programming has been a blast!</p>
