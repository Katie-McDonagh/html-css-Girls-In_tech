          <h1>Hi, I'm Shannon Farvolden! 👩‍💻</h1>

          <p>
            I am a software engineer who is passionate about emerging
            technologies, and continually challenging myself in learning new
            skills. I graduated from UBC Okanagan with Honours in Computer
            Science and now work as a Software Engineer at Pace Revenue
            Management. Outside of work you can find me at tech meetups,
            hackathons, and getting involved in mentorship programs.
